# Microprocessor implementation in Verilog
Implementation of an simple microprocessor in Verilog.

## Microprocessor Details
Our microprocessor supports 4 instructions: add, load, store, jump.      
Also our microprocessor is not pipelined; the fetch -> decode -> execute cycle is done in 1 clk cycle.

The encodings for each instructions are shown as below:

The implementations and the figures are adapted from the final project of SNU Logic Design (2025 Spring).
